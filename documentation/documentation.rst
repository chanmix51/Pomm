Overview
********

Pomm is a fast, lightweight, efficient model manager for Postgresql written in PHP. It can be seen as an enhanced object hydrator above PDO with the following features:

 * Database Inspector to build automatically your PHP model files. Table inheritance from Pg will make your model class to inherit from each other.
 * Namespaces are used to ovoid collision between objects located in different Pg schemas.
 * Types are converted on the fly. 't' and 'f' Pg booleans are converted into PHP booleans, so are binary, arrays, geometric and your own data types.
 * Queries results are fetched on demand to keep minimal memory fingerprint.
 * It is possible to register anonymous PHP functions to filter fetched results prior to hydration.
 * Model objects are extensible, simply add fields in your SELECT statements.
 * Pomm uses an identity mapper, fetching twice the same rows will return same instances.
 * You can register code to be executed before and/or after each query (logs, filters, event systems ...)

Databases and converters
************************

Service: the database provider
==============================

Database class and isolation level
-----------------------------------

The ``Service`` class just stores your ``Database`` instances and provides convenient methods to create connections from them. There are several ways to declare databases to the service class. Either you use the constructor passing an array "name" => "connection parameters" or you can use the ``setDatabase()`` method of the service class.::

    # The two examples below are equivalent
    # Using the constructor
    $service = new Pomm\Service(array(
      'db_one' => array(
        'dsn' => 'pgsql://user:pass@host:port/db_a'
      ),
      'db_two' => array(
        'dsn'   => 'pgsql://otheruser:hispass@!/path/to/socket/directory!/db_b',
        'class' => 'App\MyDb',
        'identity_mapper' => 'App\MyIdentityMapper',
        'name'  => 'my_db'
      )
      ));
    
    # Using the setDatabase method
    $service = new Pomm\Service();
    $service->setDatabase('db_one', new Pomm\Connection\Database(array(
      'dsn' => 'pgsql://user:pass@host:port/db_a'
    )));
    $service->setDatabase('db_two', new App\MyDb(array(
      'dsn' => 'pgsql://otheruser:hispass@!/path/to/socket/directory!/db_b',
      'identity_mapper' => 'App\MyIdentityMapper',
      'name'  => 'my_db'
    )));

The *setDatabase* method is used internally by the constructor. The parameters may be any of the following:
 * ``dsn`` (mandatory): a URL like string to connect the database. It is in the form ``pgsql://user:password@host:port/database_name``
 * ``class``: The *Database* class to instantiate as a database. This class must extend ``Pomm\Database`` as we will see below.
 * ``isolation``: transaction isolation level. (default is ``ISOLATION_READ_COMMITTED``, see `Standard transactions`_)
 * ``name``: the database alias name. If none is provided, the database real name is substitued. This option is notably used for namespacing map classes during database introspection (see `PHP tools`_ and `Introspected tables`_).

Once registered, you can retrieve the databases with their name by calling the *getDatabase* method passing the name as argument. If no name is given, the first declared *Database* will be returned.

DSN
---

The **dsn** parameter format is important because it interacts with the server's access policy.

 * **socket connection**
 * ``pgsql://user/database`` Connect *user* to the db *database* without password through the Unix socket system. This is the DSN's shortest form.
 * ``pgsql://user:pass/database`` The same but with password.
 * ``pgsql://user:pass@!/path/to/socket!/database`` When the socket is not in the default directory, it is possible to specify it in the host part of the DSN. Note it is surrounded by '!' and there are NO ending /. Using the «!» as delimiter assumes there are no «!» in your socket's path. But you don't have «!» in your socket's path do you ?
 * ``pgsql://user@!/path/to/socket!:port/database`` Postgresql's listening socket name are the same as TCP ports. If different than default socket, specify it in the port part.
 * **TCP connection**
 * ``pgsql://user@host/database`` Connect *user* to the db *database* on host *host* using TCP/IP.
 * ``pgsql://user:pass@host:port/database`` The same but with password and TCP port specified. 

The ``identity_mapper`` option gives you the opportunity to register an identity mapper. When connections are created, they will instantiate the given class. By default, the Smart IM is loaded. This can be overridden for specific connections (see the identity mapper section below).

Converters
==========

Built-in converters
-------------------

The ``Database`` class brings access to mechanisms to create connections and also to register converters. A ``Converter`` is a class that translates a data type from Postgresql to PHP and from PHP to Postgresql. 

By default, the following converters are registered, this means you can use them without configuring anything:
 * ``Boolean``: convert postgresql booleans 't' and 'f' to/from PHP boolean values
 * ``Number``: convert postgresql 'smallint', 'bigint', 'integer', 'decimal', 'numeric', 'real', 'double precision', 'serial', 'bigserial' types to numbers
 * ``String``: convert postgresql 'varchar', 'uuid', 'xml' and 'text' into PHP string
 * ``Timestamp``: convert postgresql 'timestamp', 'date', 'time' to PHP ``DateTime`` instance.
 * ``Interval``: convert postgresql's 'interval' type into PHP ``SplInterval`` instance. 
 * ``Binary``: convert postgresql's 'bytea' type into PHP string.
 * ``Array``: convert postgresql arrays from/to PHP arrays.

Registering converters
----------------------

Other types are natively available in postgresql databases but are not loaded automatically by Pomm.

 * ``Point``: postgresql 'point' representation as ``Pomm\Type\Point`` instance.
 * ``Segment``: 'segment' representation as ``Pomm\Type\Segment``.
 * ``Circle``: 'circle' representation as ``Pomm\Type\Circle``.

Postgresql contribs come with handy extra data type (like HStore, a key => value array and LTree a materialized path data type). If you use these types in your database you have to **register the according converters** from your database instance::

  # The HStore converter converts a postgresql HStore to a PHP associative 
  # array and the other way around.
  # The following line registers the HStore converter to the default 
  # database.
  
  $service
    ->getDatabase()
    ->registerConverter(
      'HStore', 
       new Pomm\Converter\PgHStore(), 
       array('hstore')
      );

Arguments to instanciate a ``Converter`` are the following:
 * the first argument is the converter name. It is used in the map classes to link with fields (see `Map Classes`_ below).
 * the second argument is the instance of the ``Converter``
 * the third argument is a type or a set of types for Pomm to link them with the given converter.

If your database has a lot of custom types, it is a better idea to create your own ``Database`` class.::

  class MyDatabase extends Pomm\Connection\Database
  {
    protected function initialize()
    {
      parent::initialize();
      $this->registerConverter('HStore', 
        new Pomm\Converter\Hstore(), array('hstore'));

      $this->registerConverter('Point', 
        new Pomm\Converter\Pgpoint(), array('point'));

      $this->registerConverter('Circle', 
        new Pomm\Converter\PgCircle(), array('circle'));
    }
  }

This way, converters will be automatically registered at instantiation.

Converters and types
====================
Domains
-------

In case your database uses ``DOMAIN`` types you can add them to an already registered converter. The ``registerTypeForConverter()`` method stands for that.::

    $service->getDatabase('default')
      ->registerTypeForConverter('email', 'String');
      ;

In the example above, the database contains a domain ``email`` which is a subtype of ``varchar`` so it is associated with the built-in converter ``String``.

Custom types
------------
Composite types are particularly useful to store complex set of data. In fact, with Postgresql, defining a table automatically defines the according type. Hydrating type instances with postgresql values are the work of your custom converters. Let's take an example: electrical transformers windings. A transformer winding is defined by the voltage it is supposed to have and the maximum current it can stands. A transformer have two or more windings so if we define a type WindingPower we will be able to store an array of windings in our transformer table::

  -- SQL
  CREATE TYPE winding_power AS (
      voltage numeric(4,1),
      current numeric(5,3)
  );

Tables containing a field with this type will return a tuple. A good way to manipulate that kind of data would be to create a ``WindingPower`` type class::

  <?php
  
  namespace Model\Pomm\Type;
   
  class WindingPower
  {
      public $voltage;
      public $current;
   
      public function __construct($voltage, $current)
      {
          $this->voltage = $voltage;
          $this->current = $current;
      }
   
      public getPowerMax()
      {
        return $this->voltage * $this->current;
      }
  }

Here, we can see the very good side of this method: we can implement a ``getPowerMax()`` method and make our type richer. 

Writing your own converters
---------------------------

You can write your own converters for your custom postgresql types. All they have to do is to implement the ``Pomm\Converter\ConverterInterface``. This interface makes your converter to have two methods:
 * ``fromPg($data)``: convert data from Postgesql by returning the according PHP structure. The returned value will be hydrated in your entities.
 * ``toPg($data))``: returns a string with the Postgresql representation of a PHP structure. This string will be used in the SQL queries generated by the Map files to save or update entities.

Here is the converter for the ``WindingPower`` type mentioned above::

  <?php
  
  namespace Model\Pomm\Converter;
   
  use Pomm\Converter\ConverterInterface;
  use Model\Pomm\Type\WindingPower as WindingPowerType;
   
  class WindingPower implements ConverterInterface
  {
      protected $class_name;

      public function __contruct($class_name = 'Model\\Pomm\\Type\\WindingPowerType')
      {
          $this->class_name = $class_name;
      }

      public function fromPg($data, $type = null)
      {
          $data = trim($data, "()");
          $values = preg_split('/,/', $data);
   
          return new $this->class_name($values[0], $values[1]);
      }
   
      public function toPg($data, $type = null)
      {
          return sprintf("winding_power '(%4.1f,%4.3f)'", $data->voltage, $data->current);
      }
  }

Of course you can hardcode the class to be returned by the converter but it prevents others from extending your type.

Entity converter
----------------

In Postgresql, creating a table means creating a new type with the table's fields definition. Hence, it is possible to use that data type in other tables or use them as objects in your SQL queries. Pomm proposes a special converter to do so: the ``PgEntity`` converter. Passing the table data type name and the associated entity class name will grant you with embedded entities.

::

  class MyDatabase extends Pomm\Connection\Database
  {
    protected function initialize()
    {
      parent::initialize();

      $this->registerConverter('MyEntity', 
        new Pomm\Converter\PgEntity(
          $this, 
         'Database\Schema\MyEntity'
        ), 
        array('my_entity')
      );
    }
  }

Entities
********

Overview
========

What is an Entity class ?
-------------------------

Entities are what programmers use in the end of the process. They are an OO implementation of the data retrieved from the database. Most of the time, these PHP classes are automatically generated by the instrospection tool (see `PHP tools`_) but you can write you own classes by hand. They just have to extends ``Pomm\Object\BaseObject`` class to know about status (see `Life cycle`_). Important things to know about entities are **they are schemaless** and **they are data source agnostic**. 

By default, entities lie in the same directory than their map classes and de facto share the same namespace but this is only convention.

::

    <?php

    namespace Database\Schema;

    use \Pomm\Object\BaseObject;
    use \Pomm\Exception\Exception;

    class MyEntity extends BaseObject
    {
    }


Data source agnostic
--------------------

Entities do not know anything about database in general. This means they do not know how to save, retrieve or update themselves (see `Map classes`_ for that). You can use ``BaseObject`` children to store data of your web services, NoSQL database etc. They use the ``hydrate()`` method to get data and accessors to read / write data from them (see `Living with entities`_ below).

Schemaless entities
-------------------

Entities do not know anything about the structure of the tables, views etc. They are just flexible typed containers for data. They use PHP magic methods to simulate getters and setters on data they own (see `Living with entities`_ below). This is very powerful because you can access entities like it is an array an benefit from method overloads.

..

    Note that means entities do not know anything about their primary key either.

Living with entities
====================

Creator
-------

There are two ways to create entities. Use the constructor or use the ``createObject()`` method from its related map class (see `Map classes`_).

::

  $entity = new Database\Schema\MyEntity();

  $entity = $database
    ->createConnection()
    ->getMapFor('Database\Schema\MyEntity')
    ->createObject();

Both these methods accept an optional array of values that would be hydrated in the entity.

Accessors and mutators
----------------------
The abstract parent ``BaseObject`` uses magic getters and setters to dynamically build the according methods. Internally, all values are stored in an array. The methods ``set()`` and ``get()`` are the interface to this array::

  $entity = new Database\Schema\MyEntity();
  $entity->has('pika'); // false
  $entity->set('pika', 'chu');
  $entity->has('pika'); // true
  $entity->get('pika'); // chu

Note that ``get()`` can take an array with multiple attributes::

  $entity->set('pika', 'chu');
  $entity->set('plop', true);

  $entity->get(array('pika', 'plop')); // returns array('pika' => 'chu', 'plop' => true);
  $entity->get($map->getPrimaryKey()); // returns the primary key if set.


``get()`` and ``set()`` are **generic accessors**. They are used internally and cannot be overloaded. But you can also use **virtual accessors**::

    $entity = new Database\Schema\MyEntity(array('pika' => 'chu'));
    $entity->getPika();      // chu

They are called virtual because they do not exist by default but ``BaseObject`` implements the ``__call()`` method to trap accessor calls using the ``get()`` and ``set()`` generic methods. Of course all these can be overloaded::

  // in the Entity class
  public function getPika()
  {
    return strtoupper($this->get('pika'));
  }
    
  // elsewhere
  $entity = new Database\Schema\MyEntity(array('pika' => 'chu'));
  $entity->getPika();     // CHU

The methods ``set()`` and ``get()`` should be used only if you want to bypass any overload that could exist.

Interfaces and overloads
------------------------
Entities implement PHP's ``ArrayAccess`` interface to use the accessors if any. This means you can have easy access to your entity's data in your templates without bypassing accessors !

::

  // in the Entity class
  public function getPika()
  {
    return strtoupper($this->get('pika'));
  }

  // elsewhere
  $entity->setPika('chu');
  $entity->getPika();     // CHU
  $entity['pika'];        // CHU
  $entity->pika;          // CHU
  
  $entity->get('pika');   // chu

Extending entities
------------------

Of course you can extend your entities providing new accessors. If by example you have an entity with a weight in grams and you would like to have an accessor that return it in ounces::

  public function getWeightInOunce()
  {
    return round($this->getWeight() * 0.0352739619, 2);
  }

In your templates, you can directly benefit from this accessor while using the entity as an array::

  // in PHP
  <?php echo $thing['weight_in_ounce'] ?>

  // with Twig
  {{ thing.weight_in_ounce }}

Entities and database
=====================

Hydrate and convert
-------------------

It may happen you need to create objects with data as array. ``Pomm`` uses this mechanism internally to hydrate the entities with database values. The ``hydrate()`` method takes an array and merge it with the entity's internal values. Be aware PHP associative arrays keys are case sensitive shile postgresql's field names are not. If you need some sort of conversion the ``convert()`` method will help. You can overload the ``convert()`` method to create a more specific conversion (if you use web services data provider by example) but you cannot overload the ``hydrate()`` method. 

Life cycle
----------

Entities also propose mechanisms to check what state are their data compared to the data source. There are 2 states which present 4 possible combinations:

**EXIST**
  The instance is fetched from the data source.
**MODIFIED**
  This instance has been modified with mutators.

So, of course, an entity can be in both states EXIST and MODIFIED or NONE of them. The ``BaseObject`` class grants you with several methoods to check this internal state: ``isNew()``, ``isModified()`` or you can directly access the ``_state`` attribute from within your class definition::

  $entity = $map->createObject();
  $entity->isNew();           // true
  $entity->isModified();      // false
  $entity->setPika('chu');
  $entity->isNew();           // true
  $entity->isModified();      // true

***********
Map classes
***********


Overview
========

Map classes are the central point of Pomm because 
 * they are a bridge between the database and your entities
 * they own the structure of the entities 
 * They act as entity providers

Every action you will perform with your entities will use a Map class. They are roughly the equivalent of Propel's *Peer* classes. Although it might look like Propel, it is important to understand unlike the normal Active Record design pattern, entities do not even know their structure and how to save themselves. You have to use their relative Map class to save them.

Map classes represent a structure in the database and provide methods to retrieve and save data with this structure. To be short, one table or view => one map class.

To create the link between your database and your entities, all Map classes **must** at the end extends ``Pomm\Object\BaseObjectMap``. This class implements methods that directly interact with the database using the PDO layer. These methods will be explained in the chapter `Querying the database`_.

The structure of the map classes can be automatically guessed from the database hence it is possible to generate the structure part of the map files from the command line (see below). If these classes can be generated, it is advisable not to modify them by hand because modifications would be lost at the next generation. This is why Map classes are split using inheritance:
 * ``BaseYourEntityMap`` which are abstract classes inheriting from ``BaseObjectMap``
 * ``YourEntityMap`` inheriting ``BaseYourEntityMap`` which itself inherits from ``Pomm\Object\BaseObjectMap``.

``BaseYourEntityMap`` can be skipped but since Pomm proposes automatic code generation, this file can be regenerated over and over without you to loose precious custom code. This is why this file owns the data structure read from the database.

Structure
=========

Introspected tables
-------------------

When Map classes are instantiated, the method ``initialize`` is triggered. This method is responsible of setting various structural elements:
 * ``object_name``: the related table name
 * ``object_class``: the related entity's fully qualified class name
 * ``field_structure``: the fields with the corresponding converter name
 * ``primary_key``: an array with simple or composite primary key

If the table is stored in a special database schema, it must appear in the ``object_name`` attribute. If you do not use schemas, postgresql will store everything in the public schema. You do not have to specify it in the ``object_name`` attribute but it will be used in the class namespace. As ``public`` is also a reserved keyword of PHP, the namespace for the public schema is ``PublicSchema``.

Let's say we have the following table ``student`` in the ``public`` schema of the database ``College``::

  +-------------+-------------------------------+
  |   Column    |            Type               |
  +=============+===============================+
  |  reference  | character(10)                 |
  +-------------+-------------------------------+
  |  first_name | character varying             |
  +-------------+-------------------------------+
  |  last_name  | character varying             |
  +-------------+-------------------------------+
  |  birthdate  | timestamp without time zone   |
  +-------------+-------------------------------+
  |  level      | smallint                      |
  +-------------+-------------------------------+
  |  exam_dates | timestamp without time zone[] |
  +-------------+-------------------------------+

The last field ``exam_dates`` is an array of timestamps (see `Arrays`_ below). The according generated structure will be::

 <?php

  namespace College\PublicSchema\Base;

  use Pomm\Object\BaseObjectMap;
  use Pomm\Exception\Exception;

  abstract class StudentMap extends BaseObjectMap
  {
      public function initialize()
      {
          $this->object_class =  'College\PublicSchema\Student';
          $this->object_name  =  'student';
  
          $this->addField('reference', 'char');
          $this->addField('first_name', 'varchar');
          $this->addField('last_name', 'varchar');
          $this->addField('birthdate', 'timestamp');
          $this->addField('level', 'smallint');
          $this->addField('exam_dates', 'timestamp[]');
  
          $this->pk_fields = array('reference');
      }
  }

All generated map classes use PHP namespace. This namespace is composed by the database name and the database schema the table is located in. If database name is not supplied to the ``Database`` constructor (see `Database class and isolation level`_), the real database name is used. If by example, the previous table were in the ``school`` database schema, the following lines would change::

 <?php

  namespace College\School\Base;
  ...
          $this->object_class =  'College\School\Student';
          $this->object_name  =  'school.student';
  
Arrays
------

Postgresql supports arrays. An array can contain several entities all from the same type. Pomm of course supports this feature using the ``[]`` notation after the converter declaration::

    $this->addField('authors', 'varchar[]');   // Array of strings
    $this->addField('locations', 'point[]');   // Array of points

The converter system handles that and the entities will be hydrated with an array of the according type depending on the given converter. Of course, all converters must be registered prior to the declaration.

Temporary tables
----------------

Sometimes, you might want to create temporary tables. A map class can create its own table, modify it and destroy it. Let's imagine we have to create a temporary tables for students and their average scores in each discipline. The following map class could do the job::

    <?php

    namespace College\School;

    use Pomm\Object\BaseObjectMap;
    use Pomm\Object\BaseObject;
    use Pomm\Query\Where;

    class AverageStudentScoreMap extends BaseObjectMap
    {
        public function initialize()
        {
          $this->object_class =  'College\School\AverageStudentScore';
          $this->object_name  =  'school.average_student_score';

          $this->addField('reference', 'varchar');
          $this->addField('maths', 'numeric');
          $this->addField('physics', 'numeric');
          ...
        }

        public function createTable()
        {
          $sql = "CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE %s (reference VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY, ...

          $this->query(sprintf($sql, $this->getTableName()), array());
        }

        public function dropTable()
        {
          $sql = "DROP TABLE %s CASCADE";

          $this->query(sprintf($sql, $this->getTableName()), array());
        }
    }

You can create methods to change the table structure, add or drop columns etc. This is what it is done by example in the converter test script.

Querying the database
=====================

Create, update, drop
--------------------

The main goal of the map classes is to provide a layer between your database and your entities. They provide you with basic tools to save, update and delete your entities trough ``saveOne()``, ``updateOne()`` and ``deleteOne()`` methods.

::

  $entity = $map->createObject(array('pika' => 'chu', 'plop' => false));

  $map->saveOne($entity);     // INSERT

  $entity->setPika('no');
  $entity->setPlop(true);

  $map->saveOne($entity);     // UPDATE

As illustrated above, the ``saveOne()`` method saves your object whatever it is an update or an insert. It is important to know that the internal state (see `Life cycle`_) of the entity is used to determine if the object exists or not and choose between the ``INSERT`` or the ``UPDATE`` statement. 
Whatever is used, the whole structure is saved every time this method is called. In case you do just update some fields you can use the ``updateOne()`` method.
Note that if the table related to this entity sets default values (like ``created_at`` field by example) they will be **automatically hydrated in the entity**.

::

  $entity->setPika('chu');
  $entity->setPlop(false);

  $map->updateOne($entity, array('pika')); // UPDATE ... set pika='...'

  $map->getPika();            // chu
  $map->getPlop();            // true

In the example above, two fields are set and only one is updated. The result of this is the second field to be **replaced with the value from the database**. 

::

  $map->deleteOne($entity);

  $entity->isNew();           // false
  $entity->isModified();        // false

The ``deleteOne()`` method is pretty straightforward. Like the other modifiers, it hydrates the object with the deleted row from the database in case you want to save it elsewhere.

Built-in finders
----------------

The first time you generate the base map classes, it will also generate the map classes and the entity classes. Using the example with student, the empty map file should look like this::

  <?php
  namespace College\School;

  use College\School\Base\StudentMap as BaseStudentMap;
  use Pomm\Exception\Exception;
  use Pomm\Query\Where;
  use College\School\Student;

  class StudentMap extends BaseStudentMap
  {
  }

This is the place you are going to create your own finder methods. As it extends ``BaseObjectMap`` via ``BaseStudentMap`` it already has some useful finders:

 * ``findAll()`` return all entities
 * ``findByPK(...)`` return a single entity
 * ``findWhere(...)`` perform a 
   ``SELECT ... FROM my.table WHERE ...``

Finders return either a ``Collection`` instance virtually containing all model instances returned by the query (see `Collections`_) or just a related model entity instance (like ``findByPK``).

findWhere
---------

The simplest way to create a finder with Pomm is to use the ``findWhere()`` method.

findWhere($where, $values, $suffix)
  return a set of entities based on the given where clause. This clause can be a string or a ``Where`` instance.

It is possible to use it directly because we are in a Map class hence Pomm knows what table and fields to use in the query.

  /* SELECT 
       reference, 
       first_name, 
       last_name, 
       birthdate 
     FROM 
       shool.student 
     WHERE 
         birthdate > '1980-01-01 
       AND 
         first_name ILIKE '%an%'
  */

  // don't do that !
  $students = $this->findWhere("birthdate > '1980-01-01' AND first_name ILIKE '%an%'"); 
  

Of course, this is not very useful, because the date is very likely to be a parameter. A finder ``getYoungerThan`` would be::

  public function getYoungerThan(DateTime $date)
  {
  /* SELECT 
       reference, 
       first_name, 
       last_name, 
       birthdate 
     FROM 
       shool.student 
     WHERE 
         birthdate > $date
       AND 
         first_name ILIKE '%an%'
     ORDER BY 
       birthdate DESC
     LIMIT 10
  */

    return $this->findWhere("birthdate > ? AND first_name ILIKE ?", 
        array($date->format('Y-m-d'), '%an%'), 
        'ORDER BY birthdate DESC LIMIT 10'
        );
  }

All queries are prepared, this might increase the performance but it certainly increases the security. Passing the argument using the question mark makes it automatically to be escaped by the database and ovoid SQL-injection attacks. If a suffix is passed, it is appended to the query **as is**. The suffix is intended to allow developers to specify sorting a subset parameters to the query. As the query is prepared, a multiple query injection type attack is not directly possible but be careful if you pass values sent by the customer.

AND OR: The Where class
-----------------------

Sometimes, you do not know in advance what will be the clauses of your query because it depends on variable factors. You can use the ``Where`` class to chain logical statements::

  public function getYoungerThan(DateTime $date, $needle)
  {
    $where = new Pomm\Query\Where("birthdate > ?", array($date->format('Y-m-d')));
    $where->andWhere('first_name ILIKE ?', array(sprintf('%%%s%%', $needle)));

    return $this->findWhere($where, null, 'ORDER BY birthdate DESC LIMIT 10');
  }

The ``Where`` class has two very handy methods: ``andWhere`` and ``orWhere`` which can take string or another ``Where`` instance as argument. All methods return a ``Where`` instance so it is possible to chain the calls. The example above can be rewritten this way::

  public function getYoungerThan(DateTime $date, $needle)
  {
    $where = Pomm\Query\Where::create("birthdate > ?", array($date->format('Y-m-d')))
        ->andWhere('first_name ILIKE ?', array(sprintf('%%%s%%', $needle)))

    return $this->findWhere($where, null, 'ORDER BY birthdate DESC LIMIT 10');
  }

Because the ``WHERE something IN (...)`` clause needs to declare as many '?' as given parameters, it has its own constructor::

    // SELECT all_fields FROM some_table WHERE station_id IN ( list of ids );
    
    $this->findWhere(Pomm\Query\Where::createIn("station_id", $array_of_ids))

The ``Where`` instances can be combined together with respect of the logical precedence::

    $where1 = new Pomm\Query\Where('pika = ?', array('chu'));
    $where2 = new Pomm\Query\Where('age < ?', array(18));

    $where1->orWhere($where2);
    $where1->andWhere(Pomm\Query\Where::createIn('other_id', array(1,2,3,5,7,11))); 

    echo $where1; // (pika = ? OR age < ?) AND other_id IN (?,?,?,?,?,?)

Custom queries
==============

fields methods
--------------

Although it is possible to write whole plain queries by hand in the finders, this may induce coupling between your classes and the database structure. To reduce coupling effects, the map class proposes the following methods: 

* ``getSelectFields($alias)`` return an array with the field names eventually in the form of ``alias.field_name``.
* ``getGroupByFields($alias)`` same as above.
* ``getFields`` used for both methods above.
* ``getTableName($alias)`` return the table name (property object_name see the `Structure`_ chapter) 

Overloading one of these methods will modify the behavior of all built-in finders and those which use them. 

::

  // MyDatabase\Blog\PostMap Class
  public function getBlogPostsWithCommentCount(Pomm\Query\Where $where)
  {
    $sql = <<<_
    SELECT
      %s,
      COUNT(c.id) as "comment_count"
    FROM
      %s
        LEFT JOIN %s ON
            p.id = c.p_id
    WHERE
        %s
    GROUP BY
        %s
    _;

    $select_fields = join(', ', $this->getSelectFields('p'));
    $local_table = $this->getTableName('p');
    $remote_table = $this->connection->getMapFor('MyDatabase\Blog\Comment')->getTableName('c');
    $group_fields = join(', ', $this->getGroupByFields('p'));

    $sql = sprintf($sql, $select_fields, $local_table, $remote_table, $where, $group_fields);

    return $this->query($sql, $where->getValues());
  }

The ``query()`` method is available for your custom queries. It takes 2 parameters, the SQL statement and an optional array of values to be escaped. Keep in mind, the number of values must match the '?' Occurrences in the query.

Whatever you are retrieving, Pomm will hydrate objects according to what is in structure definition of your map class. **Entities do not know about their structure** they just contain data and methods. The entity instances returned here will have this extra field "comment_count" exactly as it would be a normal field. Of course if you update this entity in the database, this field will be ignored. 

Sometimes, you want to change the fields list of an entity, by example showing the age of any student. This can be done simply by overloading the ``getSelectFields()`` method in your map class::

    public function getSelectFields($alias = null)
    {
        $fields = parent::getSelectFields($alias);
        $fields[] = sprintf('age(%sbirthday) AS age',
            is_null($alias) ? '' : $alias.'.');

        return $fields;
    }

But you can also choose not to retrieve some columns by filtering the fields (like columns containing passwords by example). Be aware that ``getSelectFields()`` changes is used in the ``SELECT`` part but does not change the ``GROUP BY``. If your queries need both to be updated in the same time, overload the ``getFields()`` method.

Virtual fields
--------------

As soon as tables have their own data type, they can be considered as plain objects and fetched as is::

    SELECT author FROM author;
    |      author       |
    +-------------------+
    | "(1,'john doe')"  |
    +-------------------+
    | "(2,'Edgar')"     |
    +-------------------+

Pomm takes advantage of this feature using *virtual fields*. You can add fields to your select queries and tie them with a registered converter. If this converter is an entity converter the Pomm model instance will be fetched directly from the query. The example below creates a relationship between the author and the post tables getting all the posts from one author in an array of Post instances::

    // YourDb\SchemaName\AuthorMap

    public function getOneWithPosts($author_name)
    {
        $remote_map = $this->connection->getMapFor('YourDb\SchemaName\Post');

        $sql = <<<_
        SELECT 
          %s,
          array_agg(post) AS posts
        FROM 
          %s 
            LEFT JOIN %s ON 
                author.id = post.author_id 
        WHERE
            author.name = ?
        GROUP BY 
          %s
        _;

        $sql = sprintf($sql, 
            join(', ', $this->getSelectFields('author')), 
            $this->getTableName('author'), 
            $remote_map->getTableName('post'),
            $this->getGroupByFields('author')
            );

        $this->addVirtualField('posts', 'schema_name.post[]');

        return $this->query($sql, array($author_name));
    }

In this example we assume the ``schema_name.post`` type has already been associated with the ``PgEntity`` converter with its map class (see `Entity converter`_). The fetched ``Author`` instances will have an extra attribute ``posts`` containing an array of ``Post`` instances (see `Arrays`_). This is a very powerful feature because you can fetch directly any entity's related objects from the database and hydrate them on the fly.

Collections
===========

fetching results
----------------

The ``query()`` method return a ``Collection`` instance that holds the PDOStatement with the results. The ``Collection`` class implements the ``Coutable`` and ``Iterator`` interfaces so you can foreach on a Collection to retrieve the results:

::

  printf("Your search returned '%d' results.", $collection->count());

  foreach($collection as $blog_post)
  {
    printf("Blog post '%s' posted on '%s' by '%s'.", 
        $blog_post['title'], 
        $blog_post['created_at']->format('Y-m-d'), 
        $blog_post['author']
        );
  }

Sometimes, you want to access a particular result in a collection knowing the result's index. It is possible using the ``has()`` and ``get()`` methods:

::

  # Get the an object from the collection at a given index 
  # or create a new one
  if index does not exist 
  $object = $collection->has($index) ?
    $collection->get($index) : 
    new Object();

Collections have other handful methods like:
 * ``isFirst()``
 * ``isLast()``
 * ``isEmpty()``
 * ``isOdd()``
 * ``isEven()``
 * ``getOddEven()``

Collection filters
------------------

Pomm's collection class can register filters. Filters are just functions that are executed after values were fetched from the database and before the object is hydrated with them. These filters take the array of fetched values as parameter. They return an array with values which are then given to the next filter and so on. After all filters are being executed, the values are then used to hydrate the object instance related the map the collection comes from. 

::

    $collection = $this->query($sql, $values);

    $collection->registerFilter(function($values) {
        $values['good_pika'] = $values['pika'] == 'chu' ? 'Good' : 'Try again';

        return $values;
        });

The code above register a filter that create an extra field in our result set. Every time a result is fetched, this anonymous function will be triggered and the resulting values will be hydrated in the entity.

Pagers
======

Pager query methods
-------------------

``BaseObjectMap`` instances provide 2 methods that will grant you with a ``Pager`` class. ``paginateQuery()`` and the handy ``paginateFindWhere()``. It adds the correct subset limitation at the end of you query. Of course, it assumes you do not specify any LIMIT nor OFFSET sql clauses in your query. 

The ``paginateFindWhere()`` method acts pretty much like the ``findWhere()`` method (see `Built-in finders`_) which it uses internally. This means the condition can be either a string or a ``Pomm\Query\Where`` instance (see `AND OR: The Where class`_)::

  $pager = $student_map
    ->paginateFindWhere('age < ? OR gender = ?', array(19, 'F'), 'ORDER BY score ASC', 25, 4);

The example below ask Pomm to retrieve the fourth page of students that match some condition with 25 results per page.

The ``paginateQuery()`` acts like the ``query()`` method but you need to provide 2 SQL queries: the one that returns results and the one that counts the total number of rows that first query would return without paging.

Displaying a pager
------------------

``Pager`` instances come with methods to display basic page informations like page count, current page, first result row etc. Here is an example of how to display a page in a twig template::

  <ul>
    {% for student in pager.getCollection() %}
      <li>{{ student }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  {% if pager.getLastPage() > 1 %}
  <div class="pager"><p>
  <a href="{{ app.url_generator.generate('news') }}">First</a>
  {% if pager.isPreviousPage() %}
  <a href="{{ app.url_generator.generate('news', {'page': pager.getPage - 1}) }}">Previous</a>
  {% else %}
  Previous
  {% endif %}
  News {{ pager.getResultMin() }} to {{ pager.getResultMax() }}
  {% if pager.isNextPage() %}
  <a href="{{ app.url_generator.generate('news', {'page': pager.getPage + 1} ) }}">Next</a>
  {% else %}
  Next
  {% endif %}
  <a href="{{ app.url_generator.generate('news', {'page': pager.getLastPage} ) }}">Last</a>
  </p></div>
  {% endif %}

***********
Connections
***********

Overview
========

Map classes provider
--------------------

As soon as you have a database instance, you can create new connections. This is done by using the ``createConnection()`` method. Connections are the way to
 * Retrieve map classes instances
 * Manage transactions

The entities are stored in a particular database. This is why only connections to this base are able to give you associated map classes::

  $map = $service->getDatabase()->createConnection()
    ->getMapFor('College\School\Student'); 
  

Identity mappers
----------------

Connections are also the way to tell the map classes to use or not an ``IdentityMapper``. An indentity mapper is an index kept by the connection and shared amongst the map instances. This index ensures that if an object is retrieved twice from the database, the same ``Object`` instance will be returned. This is a very powerful (and dangerous) feature. There are two ways to declare an identity mapper to your connections:
 * in the ``Database`` parameters. All the connections created for this database will use the given ``IdentityMapper`` class.
 * when instanciating the connection through the ``createConnection()`` call. This enforces the parameter given to the ``Database`` class if any. 

 ::

  $map = $service->getDatabase()
    ->createConnection(new \Pomm\Identity\IdentityMapperSmart())
    ->getMapFor('College\School\Student');

  $student1 = $map->findByPK(array('id' => 3));
  $student2 = $map->findByPK(array('id' => 3));

  $student1->setName('plop');
  echo $student2->getName();    // plop

It is often a good idea to have an identity mapper by default, but in some cases you will want to switch it off and ensure all objects you fetch from the database do not come from the mapper. This is possible passing the ``Connection`` an instance of ``IdentityMapperNone``. It will never keep any instances. There are two other types of identity mappers:
 * ``IdentityMapperStrict`` which always return an instance if it is in the index.
 * ``IdentityMapperSmart`` which checks if the instance has not been deleted. If data are fetched from the db, it checks if the instance kept in the index has not been modified. If not, it merges the fetched values with its instance.

It is of course always possible to remove an instance from the mapper by calling the ``removeInstance()``. You can create your own identity mapper, just make sure your class implement the ``IdentityMapperInterface``. Be aware the mapper is called for each values fetched from the database so it has a real impact on performances.

**Important** The identity mappers strict and smart rely on the use of primary keys to identify records. If you use a table without primary keys, these identity mappers will **NOT** store any of these entities.

Transactions
============

Standard transactions
---------------------

By default, connections are in auto-commit mode which means every change in the database is committed on the fly. Connections offer the way to enter in a transaction mode::

  $cnx = $service->getDatabase()
    ->createConnection();
  $cnx->begin();
  try {
    # do things here
    $cnx->commit();
  } catch (Pomm\Exception\Exception $e) {
    $cnx->rollback();
  }

The transaction type is determined by ``ISOLATION LEVEL`` you set in your connection's parameters (see `Database class and isolation level`_) 

Isolation level must be one of ``Pomm\Connection\Connection::ISOLATION_READ_COMMITTED``, ``ISOLATION_READ_REPEATABLE`` or ``ISOLATION_SERIALIZABLE``. Check your Postgresql version for the available levels. Starting from pg 9.1, what was called ``SERIALIZABLE`` is called ``READ_REPEATABLE`` and ``SERIALIZABLE`` is a race for the first transaction to COMMIT. This means if the transaction fails, you may just try again until it works. Check the `postgresql documentation <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/transaction-iso.html>`_ about transactions for details.

Partial transactions and savepoints
-----------------------------------

Sometime, you may need to split transactions into parts and be able to perform partial rollback. Postgresql lets you use save points in your transaction::

  $cnx->begin();
  try {
    # do things here
  } catch (Pomm\Exception\Exception $e) {
    // The whole transaction is rolled back
    $cnx->rollback(); 
    exit;
  }
  $cnx->setSavepoint('A');
  try {
    # do other things
  } catch (Pomm\Exception\Exception $e) {
  // only statments after savepoint A are rolled back
    $cnx->rollback('A'); 
  }
  $cnx->commit();

Query filter chain
==================

LoggerFilterChain
-----------------
The Connection class also holds and the heart of Pomm's query system: the ``QueryFilterChain``. The filter chain is an ordered stack of filters which can be executed. As the first filter is executed it can call the following filter. The code before the next filter call will be executed before and the code placed after will be run after. 
This mechanism aims at wrapping the query system with tools like loggers or event systems. It is also possible to bypass completely the query execution as long as you return a ``PDOStatement`` instance.

::

  $database = new Pomm\Connection\Database(array('dsn' => 'pgsql://user/database'));
  $logger = new Pomm\Tools\Logger();

  $connection = $database->createConnection();
  $connection->registerFilter(new Pomm\FilterChain\LoggerFilter($logger));

  $students = $connection
    ->getMapFor('MyDb\School\Student')
    ->findWhere('age > ?', array(18), 'ORDER BY level DESC');

  $logger->getLogs() 
  /* Array( 
       "1327047962.9422" => Array(
         'sql'       => 'SELECT ... FROM school.student WHERE age > ? ORDER BY level DESC', 
         'params'    => array(18), 
         'duration'  => 0.003079,
         'results'   => 23
       ))
   */

Writing a Filter
----------------
Writing a filter is very easy, it just must implement the ``FilterInterface``.

::

  class MyFilter implements \Pomm\Filter\FilterInterface
  {
      public function execute(\Pomm\Filter\QueryFilterChain $query_filter_chain)
      {
          // Do something before the query is executed

          // Call the next filter
          // If you do not, the query will never be executed. 
          // Be sure to return a PDOStatement or throw an Exception.
          $stmt = $query_filter_chain->executeNext($query_filter_chain);

          // Do something after the query is executed
  
          return $stmt;
      }
  }

You can register as many filters as you want but keep in mind filters are executed for every single query so it may slow down dramatically your application. 

*****
Tools
*****

PHP tools
=========

Pomm comes with ``Tools`` classes to assist the user in some common tasks. The most used tool is the ``BaseMap`` classes generation from database inspection. Here is a way you can use this tool to generate all the model files based on the database structure::

  <?php

  require __DIR__.'/vendor/pomm/test/autoload.php';

  $database = new Pomm\Connection\Database(array(
          'dsn'  => 'pgsql://nss_user:nss_password@localhost/nss_db',
          'name' => 'my_db'
          ));

  $scan = new Pomm\Tools\ScanSchemaTool(array(
      'prefix_dir'=> __DIR__,
      'schema' => 'transfo',
      'database' => $database
  ));

  $scan->execute();

This will parse the postgresql's schema named *transfo* to scan it for tables and views. Then it will generate automatically the *BaseMap* files with the class structure and if map files or entity files do not exist, will create them. By default, with the code above, the following tree structure will be created from the directory this code is invoked::

    /prefix/dir/MyDb
    └── Transfo
        ├── Base
        │   └── TransformerMap.php
        ├── TransformerMap.php
        └── Transformer.php

By default, the directory structure will be "/%dbname%/%schema%" hence the namespace structure be the same to follow the PSR-0 specification. It is possible you define your own using the namespace option with the `%dbname%` and `%schema%` placeholders. Here are the available options:

 * `prefix_dir` the directory in which to create the model tree.
 * `database` a `Database` instance.
 * `schema` (optionnal) the schema to scan (default public).
 * `namespace` (optionnal) a string containing the namespace format (default \%dbname%\%schema%).
 * `parent_namespace` (optionnal) a string containing the namespace format of the parent's namespace (default \%dbname%\%schema%).
